# Modeling Children's Speech for a Reading Tutor

This project explores automatic speech recognition (ASR) for children's speech using the [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) framework. The goal is to improve reading assistance tools by adapting ASR modelsâ€”typically trained on adult speechâ€”to better recognize and understand childrenâ€™s voices.

We started exploring VTLN in Kaldi and we integrated the following methods in ESPnet:
- Post-processing the features: Warping the filter banks by using torch.nn.functional.grid_sample
- Pre-processing the features:
   - 1) Warping the librosa mel matrix by also using torch.nn.functional.grid_sample
   - 2) Creating a triangular mel filters from scratch with our own function. This technique is not on point yet.

## Summary

- **Framework**: ESPnet2
- **ASR Techniques**: Hybrid CTC/Attention model
- **Datasets we used**:
  - **CGN** (Corpus Gesproken Nederlands) -> to train adult model
  - **CHOREC** (Children's Oral Reading Corpus) -> to apply warping and decode
- **Goal**: Integrated VTLN into the ASR pipeline. Estimating speaker-specific warping factors based on miminmum ASR loss.


### How to use it
- Train model by running stage 3 - 11 in ESPnet (asr.sh file)
- Run warping script by inserting Stage 16 in asr.sh
    - This requires some new files and some changes in ESPnet, which are explained below
- Decode as usual by running Stage 12

## ðŸ”§ Setup

### 1. Clone ESPnet2
[ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet)

### 2. Update the following ESPnet files:
- Changes are marked as:
  - "#ARAM ============"
  - changes here
  - "#ARAM ============"
- Also some functions are adapted to accept "utt2warp"

- In order to use read "utt2warp_ref" from the dump data folder during decoding, we need to apply the following changes to ESPnet:
  - /espnet/espnet2/train/collate_fn.py
  - /espnet/espnet2/train/dataset.py
  - /espnet/espnet2/asr/espnet_model.py
  - /espnet/espnet2/bin/asr_inference.py
 
### 4. Add the following new files
- add /espnet/espnet2/asr/warp_layer.py
  - You can choose the warping function here: f/alpha or f**alpha
- add espnet_speaker_warping.py to your project directory (egs/...)
  
### 5. Run with asr.sh
We recommend using our asr_new.sh script
- asr.sh:
  - Stage 12: allow variable data keys "True"
  - Insert Stage 16

### 6. If you want to continue working on pre-processing the features
This is the same principle, but just different warping technique

- Changes in ESPnet to use warping in the default frontend:
  - espnet/espnet2/asr/frontend/default.py
  - espnet/espnet2/layers/log_mel.py
    
In log_mel.py there are 2 options to shift the mel banks:
- Interpolate the librosa mel matrix and shift with f/alpha or f**alpha
    - Use warp_melmat_differentiable for this 
- Use the new differentiable mel filter 
  - Use make_slaney_vtln_mel_filterbank for this
